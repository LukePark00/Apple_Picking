# Apple_Picking
The Apple Picking display is a generative art piece that animates a falling apple. The piece randomly generates one of two animations: one of a successful apple pick, where the apple falls into a basket, and another which shows the apple falling and bouncing on the ground. The piece is meant to be displayed hanging.
